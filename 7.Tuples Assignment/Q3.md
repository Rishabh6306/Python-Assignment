# Q3. What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?

# A huge difference between tuples and lists in python. 

# 1 First differce is if we want to define tuples then we use Parentesis () but if we want to define a list then we use Square brackets [].

# 2. Tuples are immutable meaning that once a tuple has been created , the items cann't be cahnged. But in list it is mutable meaning  I can change the items of the list.

# 3. We cannot do indexing in tuples but in the list it is possible.

# 4. Tuples are ordered but lists are unordered.
