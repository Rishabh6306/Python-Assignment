# Q1. What is a tuple in Python?

# Tuples used to store Multiple Values in a single varaible we have also multiple things in python for storing a single variable. But we use tuples because Tuples are immutable and ordered, meaning that once a tuple has been created, the items in it can't change. 

# EX:

t = (20, False, "Rishabh", "Story")
print(type(t))
print(t)
