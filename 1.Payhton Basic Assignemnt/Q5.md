## Q. 5 Using an example, explain how the variables in python are dynamic in nature. ##

In Python, variables are dynamic in nature, which means that they can hold different types of data and their data type can change at runtime. This is in contrast to statically-typed languages, where variables have a fixed data type that is determined at compile time.

x = 10  # x is an integer
print(type(x))  # output: <class 'int'>

x = "hello"  # x is now a string
print(type(x))  # output: <class 'str'>

x = [1, 2, 3]  # x is now a list
print(type(x))  # output: <class 'list'>
